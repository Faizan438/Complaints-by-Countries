# README

## Overview
This project utilizes Python and the pandas library to perform data analysis on a dataset loaded from a CSV file (`faizan.csv.csv`). The notebook is structured for easy data exploration and processing.

## Features
- Imports and processes data using the pandas library.
- Reads the dataset from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
- Provides insights into the dataset, including column information and data types.

## File Structure
- **Notebook File**: The main notebook file contains the code and markdown documentation.
  - Code for loading the dataset.
  - Examples of pandas operations.
- **Dataset**: `faizan.csv.csv`, the input dataset used for analysis.

## Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pandas library

Install pandas using pip if it’s not already installed:
```bash
pip install pandas
```

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file.
2. Place the dataset (`faizan.csv.csv`) in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
```bash
jupyter notebook faizan.ipynb
```
4. Run the cells sequentially to execute the code and analyze the dataset.

## Example Output
Here’s a snippet of the output generated from the notebook:
```
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 117 entries, 0 to 116
Data columns (total 13 columns):
 #   Column           Non-Null Count  Dtype 
---  ------           --------------  ----- 
 0   Country          116 non-null    object
 1   2019_Complaints  117 non-null    int64 
 2   2019_Losses      117 non-null    int64 
...
```
This output displays the structure of the loaded dataset, including column names, data types, and non-null counts.
